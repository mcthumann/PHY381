class RiverFormation:
    """River formation model based off Kramer, Marder's paper "Evolution of river networks" 1993
    Land, and Water are maps of the same size that give, at each point, the height of soil, and the amount of water
    sitting on top of the soil respectively. The program loosely follows the following ruleset quoted from the above
    paper:
            (I) At each site of a lattice, we specify two integers, one corresponding to the height of land, the other to the height ofwater.
            (2) A lattice site is chosen randomly, and if the surface height (water plus land) is lower on a neighboring site, water units are moved to bring the surfaces as close to even as possible.
            (3) For each water unit transported out, a unit of land is dissolved away â€”but only if the land is lower at the destination site.
            (4) Additional water falls on a site as precipitation at random intervals.

    Parameters
    map_size (int, int): Sets the size of the corresponding land and water maps
    erosion_rate (float): Controls the rate of erosion
    land_initial_height (int): Initial height of the land plot
    precipitation (float): At each random precipitation site, this much watter is added
    land_condition (int): More of an enum to dictate the initial conditions of the land:
        0: Flat initial condition
        1: Random initial condition with randomness scaled by precipitation
        2: Sloping downward initial condition with slope set by precipitation
